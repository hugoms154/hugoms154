# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I'm Hugo, a software developer with experience in the development world since 2021. I have a degree as a Computer Technician and I'm also certified in the Gostack Bootcamp by Rocketseat.

üî≠ Currently, I'm working as a backend software developer at Taqtile Brasil, where I use my skills in Node.js, NestJS, TypeORM, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Apollo Server to create robust and scalable solutions.

üíª I have experience in projects for major Brazilian companies, working as a backend developer in Node.js at various stages of development. My responsibilities include implementing new features, maintaining legacy code, and carrying out extensive refactoring to ensure future maintainability of the project. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work as a full-stack developer on a project, preparing the app in React Native and the backend for language internationalization.

üéØ My focus is on backend development, especially backend. My goal is to gain in-depth knowledge of design patterns and software architecture to become a Backend Specialist.

üí° I am a determined, curious person who easily adapts to different contexts and projects. I see challenges as opportunities for learning and I am resilient when solving problems. I believe in the importance of knowledge sharing within a team and I'm always open to help and receive help.

üå± I always keep myself updated with the latest trends and technologies, seeking to deepen my knowledge through videos, events, conferences, and courses.

üöÄ My objective is to work on projects that have purpose and challenge me both as a developer and as an individual. I strive to contribute to the success of teams and the development of impactful solutions.
